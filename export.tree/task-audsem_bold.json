  "TaskName": "Auditory Semantic Judgement",
  "Instructions": "Meaning task: Determine if two words are related. Tone task: Determine if two tones are the same. Respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Please keep head still.",
  "TaskDescription": "Participants were presented with 50 semantic (meaning) judgement trials and 50 perceptual control tone judgement trials arranged into alternating 10 trial blocks, beginning with a semantic block. A 4000 ms instructions screen was presented at the beginning of each block which contained one word indicating the type of judgment, meaning or tones. In each trial three auditory stimuli were presented sequentially, each accompanied by a white fixation cross against a black background for 1000 ms. Following the third stimuli a yellow fixation cross was presented to indicate that the participants should make a response. The yellow fixation cross was presented for 1930 ms in semantic trials and for 1850 ms in control trials. Participants could make a response from the beginning of the third stimulus until the end of the trial. In semantic trials, stimuli consisted of three English words and participants were asked to judge whether the final word related to one of the first two words. 30 of the 50 meaning trials contained matches and of these, 15 contained matches between the first and third stimulus, and 15 contained matches between the second and third stimulus. In perceptual control tone trials, participants were presented with three pure tones which were either high (700 Hz), medium (500 Hz) or low (300 Hz) frequency. Each tone was 600 ms in duration and contained a 100 ms linear fade in and fade out. 30 of the 50 control trials contained a matching tone pair with 15 of those being a match between the first and third stimuli and 15 being a match between the second and third stimuli. Trials were pseudo-randomly assigned to blocks and all participants completed trials and blocks in the same fixed order. Each task lasted approximately 9 minutes. All lexical auditory stimuli were recorded by a native Chicagoan female voice in a soundproof booth with a digital recorder and a high-quality microphone. Words longer than 800 ms were shorted through linear transformation to 800 ms. All words were normalized in amplitude.",
