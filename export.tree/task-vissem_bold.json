  "TaskName": "Auditory Semantic Judgjement",
  "Instructions": "Meaning task: Determine if two words are related. Lines task: Determine if two groups of lines are the same. Respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Please keep head still.",
  "TaskDescription": "Participants were presented with 50 semantic (meaning) judgement trials and 50 perceptual control line judgement trials arranged into alternating 10 trial blocks, beginning with a semantic block. A 4000 ms instructions screen was presented at the beginning of each block which contained one word indicating the type of judgment, meaning or lines. In each trial, three visual stimuli were presented sequentially for 800 ms followed by a 200 ms blank inter stimulus interval. Following the third inter stimulus interval, a yellow fixation cross was presented for 1910 ms to indicate that the participants should make a response. Participants could make a response from the beginning of the third stimulus until the end of the trial. In semantic trials, stimuli consisted of three English words and participants were asked to judge whether the final word related to one of the first two words. 30 of the 50 meaning trials contained matches and of these, 15 contained matches between the first and third stimulus, and 15 contained matches between the second and third stimulus. In perceptual control line trials, participants were presented with a set of three non-linguistic symbols each of which consisted of two straight lines (e.g., / \ , \ \ , / /, \ /). 30 of the 50 control trials contained a matching symbol pair with 15 of those being a match between the first and third stimuli and 15 being a match between the second and third stimuli. Trials were pseudo-randomly assigned to blocks and all participants completed trials and blocks in the same fixed order. Each task lasted approximately 9 minutes.",
